          project.

        <p>This application was built using the MEAN Stack:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The front end is an Angular 4 / Typescript project created with the excellent Angular-CLI</li>
          <li>The back end uses Node v.6.9.2 and Express</li>
          <li>Data is hosted in the cloud at MLab, using MongoDB and Mongoose</li>
          <li>The authentication module uses Bcrypt.js for password encryption and JSON Web Tokens for maintaining secure sessions</li>
          <li>UI Components are based on Bootstrap and animated with the Angular animations module.</li>
          <li>The doughnut chart was created using Chart.js</li>
        </ul>
